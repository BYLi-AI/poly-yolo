The original PIL data augmentation replaced by OpenCV augmentation. 
The main advantage is the processing speed. 
OpenCV is much faster, so it removes the CPU bottleneck during training on larger batches.
The new augmentation includes:
- Random scaling. Images are bigger/smaller
- Shifting. Image is placed on a different position
- Jittering. Aspect ratio is slightly changed
- CLAHE. Adaptive histogram equalization
- HSV augmentation. Both additive and multiplicative versions
- Flipping. Horizontal version
- Noise. Random strength of noise based on the variance of the data
